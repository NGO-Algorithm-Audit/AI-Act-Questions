      "ui:description": "Data encompasses all forms of electronic information, including text, images, and audio. Various types of algorithms can be derived from data. In rule-based algorithms, thresholds for (decision) rules or weighting factors for decisions can be calculated from data. Classical statistical models, such as regression models, are also derived from data. Machine learning is used to train a model from data. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, utilize machine learning."

      "ui:description": "An example of rules established in laws or regulations is a rule-based algorithm that automatically determines whether the income and asset requirements are met when applying for social assistance. In this case, the rules in the algorithm are a direct implementation of norms set, for instance, in the Dutch Participation Act.\n\nWhen a standard is not clearly defined in legislation and is interpreted, the application is not a one-to-one automation of the law or regulation.\n\nExamples of rules created by humans include a rule-based algorithm where a work instruction is translated into a decision rule, a risk profile where the rules are manually created based on employees' experience, or legal standards that are further specified into rules.\n\nLogic- and knowledge-based approaches are also known as symbolic AI systems. These types of AI systems include knowledge representation, inductive (logical) programming, knowledge bases, inference and deduction machines, and (symbolic) reasoning. These forms of technology are rare."
