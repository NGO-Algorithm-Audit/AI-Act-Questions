# AI Act Questions

AI Act questions based on AI Act defintions and the definition of High Impact Algorithm in the Algorithm Registery guidance by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior (https://algoritmes.pleio.nl/attachment/entity/f1a35292-7ea6-4e47-93fa-b3358e9ab2e0)
The questions are developed in collaboration with the Muncipality of Amsterdam

The templates are available in JSON format and can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of an organization.

# How it works.

The JSON schema's use the [React JSON Schema Form (RJSF) library](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form), this library is built on top of: [Json schema's](https://json-schema.org/) which should make it easy to implement the schema's in your own tech stack.
Please read the [RSJF documentation](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) for information about how the forms and dependencies work.

# Demo

To easily demo our questions, either run our [opinionated implementation](https://github.com/NGO-Algorithm-Audit/AI-Act-Implementation-Tool), or copy the key value pairs of the JSON into the correct input of the [(RJSF) playground](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/)
