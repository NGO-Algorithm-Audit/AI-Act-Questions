# AI Act Questions

AI Act questions based on AI Act requirements and soft law frameworks, such as the Research framework Algorithms of the Netherlands Executive Audit Agency, the Algorithm framework of the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and the Dutch Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (IAMA).

The templates are available in JSON format and can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of an organization.

# How it works.

The JSON schema's use the [React JSON Schema Form (RJSF) library](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) setup, this is built on top of: [Json schema's](https://json-schema.org/) which should make it easy to implement in your own tech stack.
Please read the [RSJF documentation](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) for information about how the forms work.

To easily demo our questions, either run our opinioated implementation (LINK), or copy the key value pairs of the JSON into the correct input of the [(RJSF) playground](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/)
